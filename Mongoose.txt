Mongoose. Clean Note:
-----------------------------
With Mongoose, developers must define a Schema and Model.
-> first define schema(structure), then create model based on the schema.

#installation:
npm i mongoose.

#Connecting with database:------------------------

import mongoose from 'mongoose'

//database options
const options = {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  dbName: "blog",
};
//Connect to database.
mongoose
  .connec(
 "mongodb+srv://",    options
  )
  .then(() => console.log("Connected To Database"))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));

#Create Schema: ..will write later...

#Create Model : .. will write later...

#Insert Data method 1 (Best method):----------------------
Alternatively, we can do this in one action using the Mongoose create() method.

// Create a new blog post and insert into database
const article = await Blog.create({
  title: 'Awesome Post!',
  slug: 'awesome-post',
  published: true,
  content: 'This is the best post ever',
  tags: ['featured', 'announcement'],
});

console.log(article);

This method is much better! Not only can we insert our document, but we also get returned the document along with its _id when we console log it.
Update data.

#Insert Data method 2: ----------
const article = new Blog({
  title: 'Awesome Post!',
  slug: 'awesome-post',
  published: true,
  content: 'This is the best post ever',
  tags: ['featured', 'announcement'],
});

// Insert the article in our MongoDB database
await article.save();











With Mongoose, developers must define a Schema and Model.
-> first define schema(structure), then create model based on the schema.

What is a schema?
A schema defines the structure of your collection documents. A Mongoose schema maps directly to a MongoDB collection.
Code Snippet

const blog = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  slug: String,
  published: Boolean,
  author: String,
  content: String,
 tags: [String],
 createdAt: Date,
 updatedAt: Date,
 comments: [{
 user: String,
 content: String,
 votes: Number
}]
});



With schemas, we define each field and its data type. Permitted types are:

    String
    Number
    Date
    Buffer
    Boolean
    Mixed
    ObjectId
    Array
    Decimal128
    Map

What is a model?
Models take your schema and apply it to each document in its collection.
Models are responsible for all document interactions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD).
An important note: the first argument passed to the model should be the singular form of your collection name. Mongoose automatically changes this to the plural form, transforms it to lowercase, and uses that for the database collection name.
Code Snippet

1

const Blog = mongoose.model('Blog', blog);


In this example, 'Blog' translates to the 'blogs' collection.



npm i mongoose





Connecting to MongoDB
Now we’ll create the index.js file and use Mongoose to connect to MongoDB.
------
import mongoose from 'mongoose'
Way 1: (recommended).. define db name in option object.
const options={useNewUrlParser:true,useUnifiedTopology:true,dbName:"nameHere"};
mongoose.connect(URI_string, options);

or 

mongoose.connect(URI_string, options)
.then(()=>console.log('Connected to database'))
.catch((err)=>console.error("Connection failed",err));




way 2:using dbName with the URI.
mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.eyhty.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority")


Creating a schema and model
Before we do anything with our connection, we’ll need to create a schema and model.
Ideally, you would create a schema/model file for each schema that is needed. So we’ll create a new folder/file structure: model/Blog.js.

import mongoose from 'mongoose';
const { Schema, model } = mongoose;

const blogSchema = new Schema({
  title: String,
  slug: String,
  published: Boolean,
  author: String,
  content: String,
  tags: [String],
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date,
  comments: [{
    user: String,
    content: String,
    votes: Number
  }]
});

const Blog = model('Blog', blogSchema);
export default Blog;


Inserting data // method 1
===========================
Now that we have our first model and schema set up, we can start inserting data into our database.
Back in the index.js file, let’s insert a new blog article.


import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import Blog from './model/Blog';

mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://mongo:mongo@cluster0.eyhty.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority")

// Create a new blog post object
const article = new Blog({
  title: 'Awesome Post!',
  slug: 'awesome-post',
  published: true,
  content: 'This is the best post ever',
  tags: ['featured', 'announcement'],
});

// Insert the article in our MongoDB database
await article.save();

We first need to import the Blog model that we created. Next, we create a new blog object and then use the save() method to insert it into our MongoDB database.
Let’s add a bit more after that to log what is currently in the database. We’ll use the findOne() method for this.
// Find a single blog post
const firstArticle = await Blog.findOne({});
console.log(firstArticle);


Let’s run the code!

npm run dev

You should see the document inserted logged in your terminal.


Inserting data // method 2
In the previous example, we used the save() Mongoose method to insert the document into our database. This requires two actions: instantiating the object, and then saving it.
Alternatively, we can do this in one action using the Mongoose create() method.


// Create a new blog post and insert into database
const article = await Blog.create({
  title: 'Awesome Post!',
  slug: 'awesome-post',
  published: true,
  content: 'This is the best post ever',
  tags: ['featured', 'announcement'],
});

console.log(article);


This method is much better! Not only can we insert our document, but we also get returned the document along with its _id when we console log it.
Update data
Mongoose makes updating data very convenient too. Expanding on the previous example, let’s change the title of our article.

article.title = "The Most Awesomest Post!!";
await article.save();
console.log(article);

We can directly edit the local object, and then use the save() method to write the update back to the database. I don’t think it can get much easier than that!

Finding data
Let’s make sure we are updating the correct document. We’ll use a special Mongoose method, findById(), to get our document by its ObjectId.

const article = await Blog.findById("62472b6ce09e8b77266d6b1b").exec();
console.log(article);

Notice that we use the exec() Mongoose function. This is technically optional and returns a promise. In my experience, it’s better to use this function since it will prevent some head-scratching issues. If you want to read more about it, check out this note in the Mongoose docs about promises.
